Are you gonna make a move?

Are you gonna make a move?

 

I've been thinking about the way you look at me

Are you sure you know the one

You can tell me about this feeling, don't run deep

That I'm gonna make you love me anyway

That I'm gonna make you love

That I'm gonna make you love

That I'm gonna make you love me anyway

 

Are you gonna make a move?

 

Now the time has come to prove
